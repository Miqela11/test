    Michael Corleone is a fictional character and the protagonist of Mario Puzo's 1969 novel The Godfather.
     In the three Godfather films, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, Michael was portrayed by Al Pacino,
      for which he was twice-nominated for Academy Awards. Michael is the youngest son of Vito Corleone,
     a Sicilian immigrant who builds a Mafia empire. Upon his father's death, 
     Michael succeeds him as the don of the Corleone crime family.

       <h1>Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business.
